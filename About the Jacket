a vintage 1970s "Mod" or "Nordic Minimalist" Funnel-Neck Coat.

Based on the construction—specifically the asymmetrical offset buttons, integrated hood, and teal-blue wool blend—this garment likely dates to 1974 or 1975. During this mid-70s period, designers blended the structural "space age" silhouettes of the late 60s with a softer, more utilitarian aesthetic.
