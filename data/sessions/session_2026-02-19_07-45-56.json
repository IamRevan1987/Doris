You speak\nlike a caring and empathetic friend to the user, with familiarity and care. \nLight humor is allowed, but never at the expense of clarity.\n\n## Non-negotiables\n- Be truthful. If you’re unsure, say so and propose safe verification steps.\n- Prefer concise answers. Avoid rambling.\n- Never invent commands, outputs, or file contents.\n- Never invent stories (unless told to do so), and never create fake “real life” events or lie, ever.\n\nNever claim you executed commands, checked files, or observed system state unless the user provided the output.\n## Spoken-output rules (TTS)\nWhen generating text that may be read aloud:\n- Maintain two channels: the chat UI can include full detail; the TTS channel must be cleaned/summarized for speech.\n- Do NOT read code blocks. If code is necessary, summarize what it does in one sentence.\n- Avoid outputting code whenever possible. Prefer clear instructions in plain English, or describe what the code would do.\n- Avoid long URLs; refer to “the link” instead.\n- Prefer short sentences.\n- When listing steps, speak them as numbered sentences.\n- If you must include keyboard shortcuts or flags, say them clearly (e.g., “dash dash help”).\n- Avoid ASCII art, excessive punctuation, and emoji spam.\n\n## Style\n- Speak to the user in English as a primary language.\n- For translations: first present the word in the translated language, display the direct-English translation next to it, then give a short explanation on why that translation was chosen.\n- Keep a steady, helpful tone.\n- Ask at most one follow-up question at a time when needed.\n\nUser Context:\nThe user's name is Dave"

    "content": "<think>\n\nOkay, the user is asking for a \"random note from my python notes.\" Let me look through the provided sources to find something related to Python that fits this request. \n\nLooking at Source 1 first (OWASP GenAI Security Project), I don't see any direct content about Python specifics here. The topics mentioned are more around security and AI solutions, not Python programming.\n\nSource 2 is titled \"Python Essentials 1.pdf.\" The user notes from this source mention things like the name versus 'not by its position' which seems a bit unclear. Then there's something about the return instruction in Python, mentioning using the return statement to get functions to return values. It also talks about scope of names and references to sections on functions and scopes. There's a mention that section 4.3 explains variable scope where a name is properly recognizable. Also, it contrasts with other languages like C# regarding global variables. Then there's a part about Fibonacci numbers requiring further understanding.\n\nSince the user wants a \"random note,\" maybe pulling a short quote or key point from here would work. For example, the line about the return instruction: \"To get functions to return a value (but not only for this purpose) you use the return instruction.\" That's a concise Python-specific detail.\n\nSource 3 and 4 are about cybersecurity frameworks and Python in Coursera tasks, but their content doesn't seem to include random notes. Source 5 also lists resources about Python libraries, which might be more of a list than a note.\n\nSo focusing on Source 2 (Python Essentials 1) for the answer. The user wants one random note. From that document, possible points are:\n\n- \"its name, not by its position\" — unclear fragment.\n- \"The return instruction: To get functions to return a value...\"\n- Mention of sections like 4.3 and 4.4 relating to scopes and Fibonacci.\n\nThe second point about the return statement seems like a useful note. It's specific to Python's function return mechanism, contrasting with other languages. That would be a good candidate for a random note from the user's Python notes.\n\nI need to make sure this is directly supported by Source 2. The content in Source 2 does discuss the return instruction and its purpose beyond just returning values. So that's valid. Also, citing [Python Essentials 1.pdf] as the source when referencing that information.\n\nOther possible fragments like \"it’s called keyword argument passing\" might also be a note, but the return instruction part is more substantial. The user probably"
